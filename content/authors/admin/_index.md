Hi, I'm Zhiyang(Kurt) Wang, I'm a material science postgraduate student. Now, my major research direction is about defects induced behavior in ferroelectric material and phasefield simualtion of them. Besides my own research projects at hand, I'm also interested in some other area about material science, including combination of material science and machinen learning, ferromagnetic material, and semiconducter material.
